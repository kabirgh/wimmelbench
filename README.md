- Template matching? Give llm image of tiger and ask it to find the same tiger in a different pose in the image.

Notes
- LLMs are general purpose model. Even though there exist specialized models for vision, it would be ideal to use a single model for all tasks.
- Interested in unsaturated benchmarks. Lots of scope in vision tasks.
- Wimmelbench is analagous to needle in a haystack, though the needle is much larger.
- Results: can describe well, but can't draw bounding boxes accurately.
  - TODO: bounding box accuracy + description accuracy as function of object size:image size ratio
  - TODO: generalized IoU metric
