It's located in the smaller wading pool section near the main building, separate from the larger swimming pool. The feature is blue in color and appears to be a decorative element that sprays water for children to play with."

The castle has a few smaller buildings within its walls, including what appears to be a red-roofed structure. It's shown against a dark blue night sky with a crescent moon nearby."

There are benches or tables visible outside the cabin where people are congregating."
