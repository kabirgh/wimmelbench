      "description": "There is a small blue elephant-shaped water feature/slide in the children's pool area. This appears to be designed to look like a whale or elephant with water spraying from it. It's located in the smaller wading pool section near the main building, separate from the larger swimming pool. The feature is blue in color and appears to be a decorative element that sprays water for children to play with."
